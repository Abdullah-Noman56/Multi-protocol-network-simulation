# Multi-Protocol Network Simulation Project  
## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **design, simulation, and configuration of a scalable multi-protocol network topology** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It integrates **OSPF, EIGRP, RIP**, and also includes **DHCP, NAT, ACLs, Mail Server, and FTP Server configurations**.  

The focus was on:  
- Efficient **subnetting** using **VLSM**.  
- Enabling communication across multiple routing protocols via **route redistribution**.  
- Implementing **NAT** for secure external access.  
- Applying **ACLs** for access restrictions.  
- Configuring **centralized services** such as DHCP, Mail, and FTP servers.

## üéØ Objectives
1. Simulate a complex network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Apply **VLSM subnetting** to allocate IP addresses efficiently.  
3. Configure and implement routing protocols:  
   - **EIGRP** (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)  
   - **OSPF** (Open Shortest Path First) with **Area 1** and **Area 2**  
   - **RIP** (Routing Information Protocol)  
4. Enable **route redistribution** between protocols.  
5. Configure a **centralized DHCP server** for dynamic IP assignment.  
6. Implement **NAT (Network Address Translation)** for internet access.  
7. Apply **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** for restricted access.  
8. Configure and validate **Mail and FTP servers**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Implementation Steps
1. **Topology Design**  
   - Replicated logical network layout with routers, switches, servers, and end devices.  
   - Used **color-coded network blocks (A to N)** for organization.  

2. **VLSM Subnetting**  
   - Calculated subnets based on host requirements.  
   - Assigned **/30 subnets** for point-to-point router links to minimize waste.  

3. **Router & Interface Configuration**  
   - Assigned IP addresses to router interfaces.  
   - Configured end devices according to subnet plan.  

4. **Routing Protocols**  
   - **EIGRP**: Configured in **Blocks A & E**.  
   - **OSPF**: Configured in **Blocks B & C**, divided into **Area 1** and **Area 2**.  
   - **RIP**: Configured in **Block G**.  

5. **Route Redistribution**  
   - Implemented between EIGRP‚ÄìOSPF and OSPF‚ÄìRIP boundary routers.  

6. **DHCP Configuration**  
   - Centralized DHCP Server in **Block D**.  
   - Assigned IP addresses dynamically to hosts in **Blocks A, B, C, G**.  

7. **NAT Implementation**  
   - Router21 (Network K) and Router10 (Network F) configured for **NAT overload**.  
   - Used public IPs for external access.  

8. **ACL Configuration**  
   - Blocked:  
     - One **PC in Network A** from accessing Web Server.  
     - One **Laptop in Network E**.  
     - One **Smartphone in Network B**.  
     - **All devices in Network D** from Web Server.  

9. **Server Configuration**  
   - **Mail Server (Block D)**:  
     - IP: `192.168.12.10`  
     - Allowed email exchange between **Network H** and **Network I**.  
     - Configured with **SMTP & IMAP**.  
   - **FTP Server (Network G)**:  
     - IP: `192.173.0.4`  
     - Restricted to devices within **Network G** only.  
     - Configured with username/password authentication.  

10. **Testing & Validation**  
    - Verified IP addressing and DHCP lease assignments.  
    - Confirmed routing table correctness and redistribution.  
    - Validated NAT translations with `show ip nat translations`.  
    - Tested ACL restrictions against blocked devices.  
    - Sent/received test emails between Network H & I.  
    - Uploaded files via FTP client from Network G.
